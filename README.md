2D Dungeon Crawler Game
This game has 3 levels: easy, medium, difficult
To play, select a sprite, a difficulty level, and set your username
Navigate your way through the 3 rooms before either your time runs or your health goes negative!
Use the keypad to move up, down, left, and right
You can attack your enemies using the SHIFT key, but the more you collide with them, the faster your health decreases
Take advantage of powerups like extra health, time warp, and secret passages to beat the game.
Good Luck!
